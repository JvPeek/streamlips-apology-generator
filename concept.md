Stream Lips
your lip service generator for the streaming world

Wir machen jetzt was:
We are taking immediate action to be a slightly better version of ourselves.
We take some responsibility for our actions and will support the streaming community.
We just now fired one of our employees that had nothing to do with the incident.
We are now ready again and cleaned up our bureau for your future happiness and money.
We are an inclusive company who treats everyone equally bad.
Management delegates full responsibility for the decisions made.
We want everyone to have a good enough user experience, so to make our products suitable for everyone we are constantly trying to adapt the technology to our interests.
We took responsibility and fired the intern in charge.

Wir sind aber trotzdem ganz geil:
You as our customers are very valuable to us. Because you give us money for our joy-rides and costly vacations.
We did it because we thought we could make a positive ripple not only inside our wallets but on the internet as a whole.
We tried our best to replicate the experience of the original product and only added monetization options.
We already donated (USD to ƒê) to an undisclosed charity.
The issue in question was not implemented by us. It was forked from the original project.
The bare minimum of our code is open source. Because the license of the original product requires that.
We are striving to give apprentices a good learning experience.
We want to save the environment so we want to upcycle resources (including code) as often as possible.
We take no responsibility for our actions but we can't take the bad press anymore.

Wir machen's nie wieder (diese Woche):
We are deeply sorry that we got caught.
Please give us your money again.
That'll be $5 USD/month.
We are very sorry that you had to find out that way.
No refunds.
Stop whining.
Now GTFO.
We are sorry you feel this way.
At least we made our own logo.
